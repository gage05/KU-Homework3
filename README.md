## Description

My motivation behind this project was that I wanted to learn how to use Javascript in a more proficient way. I built this project because knowing how to generate a password with Javascript can be useful to me in the future. This project is a random password generator that prompts you for certain criteria and generates a password based on your choices. Through this project, I have learned how important Javascript is when combined with HTML and CSS.
